# xFitter-Docker

This project is deprecated, as [xFitter](https://gitlab.cern.ch/fitters/xfitter) now supports an official docker container. You can pull this from: `gitlab-registry.cern.ch/fitters/xfitter:master`. If there is some need for using an older version of xFitter you can pull the code from this project using tags or branches, but I expect the URLs to change and do not plan to maintain this project.

See the docker documentation at: <https://gitlab.cern.ch/fitters/xfitter/-/wikis/Docker>
